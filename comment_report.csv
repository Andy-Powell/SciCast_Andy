You selected ""a little lower"" in Safe mode, which normally would have done something like .02 -&gt; .016 as you say.  But my edit executed first, moving the starting probability to .0001. So your edit moved slightly lower than .0001.  We have a release scheduled for next week which should stop a trade if things change too much between the time you load the question and the time you press ""Submit"".  This one is slightly tricky because Safe mode is for beliefs.  Saying 'slightly lower than .02' declares a belief of about .01, and attempts to create a trade halfway towards that belief.  If we trust the belief is about .01, we could continue to keep that target, possibly changing the direction of the edit.

This number may or may not have any meaningful relation to either the number of merchants where Apple Pay is accepted, or (if selective NFC is possible) the number of merchants with enabled contactless payments.

So # of qubits is like inverse of log p/p_th for a target logical error rate; much better to shrink p than add qubits, yes.

Mississippi is close at 69.6% and West Virginia is next at 69.1%.Method 2:Perhaps fat states are getting fatter faster than skinny states. To adjust for that, I took each state's individual trend since 2009 to predict it's 2014 result. Using that regression, I get Arkansas and Louisiana over 70%. Mississippi is close at 69.8%, and West Virginia is next at 68.7%. Method 3: Perhaps fat states are getting fatter very fast in the last year or two.

The company rarely announces significant news during earnings calls, making today a notable exception. Some might criticize Apple for considering April to be ""early"" in the calendar year, but Cook doesn't see a problem. He said that when mapping out product launches, Apple separates the year into three, four-month windows for early, middle, and late. ""To us, it?s sort of within the range. It?s basically when we thought,"" he said. <br><br> <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7925003/apple-watch-release-date-april"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7925003/apple-watch-release-date-april</a>",2015-01-27 19:07:48.139758,0,False,False,None,1052,0.0,None,0,59

So it could be that they only have a subset of charts on a monthly basis, but expand this set for the entire year tab, with hybrid/electric vehicles being in the entire year tab.

I also stated that the line of devices may or may not be called 'Android Silver.'

(2) It would be highly preferred to change the question statement to ask about the functionality, rather than the 'platform name.'  In this case, changing the question statement to something like  '...will it include a platform (or function) to start up a media version of Windows without login...' and remove the name 'Direct Experience.'

7335,"<a class='user_reply' href='/#!/users/176'>@<span>dvasya</span></a>: I like your max-entropy argument. If all we had was the mean and variance, pick Gaussian on that basis. But two objections. 1) We know more than mean and variance: we know #samples, and even the samples themselves.  2) We don?t actually know the mean and variance at all. We estimate them based on few samples.<p>The t distribution was designed for inference from small samples, but it may not be the right one to have used here. If we assume the true distribution is Gaussian with unknown mean, the t is the distribution of that mean for i.i.d. samples. That seems to be what we want, except these samples are not i.i.d.: they arise from different methods. So I think you?re right my suggestion to QM implicitly assumed the means of those methods were normally distributed around the true mean.</p>Backing up, the problem for the future is to select the best method to use when we have conflicting estimates for the answer. Suggestions? (See also my answer to @Prieur above. And sorry for my late reply.)",2015-03-14 07:29:30.202369,0,False,False,6936,217,0.0,None,0,7
7336,"<p>@Prieur: Sorry for the delay. I put your note and @dvaya?s aside to think about and lost track. Our goal was to find a methodology that would minimize payoff error if applied to many such resolutions with conflicting estimates. Picking a single estimate at random is clearly a bad choice. We could have picked the ?best? estimate. But one had the virtue of being what had been used before (hence fair to forecasters), and the others claimed the virtue of better method. So QM first suggested splitting. That worked here, but <a class='user_reply' href='/#!/users/176'>@<span>dvasya</span></a> pointed out that as a method it had absurd consequences: again small changes in estimates led to big changes in payoffs.</p><p>Averaging is a good choice except that this wasn?t a continuous question ? our answers were discretized, so a small change in the average would lead to a big change in payoff.  So we accepted the argument we should construct a simple distribution based on the estimates, and pay off according to the probability in each bin.</p>",2015-03-14 07:31:17.259949,0,False,False,7082,217,0.0,None,0,7

You argue we should not have used an unbounded distribution.  There is a limiting case argument in your favor: if we had only 1 estimate from the report, we would have treated that as definitive.</p><p>Perhaps our solution was too clever by half.  The key question is what general method to adopt when resolving continuous questions that have been discretized into bins, esp. when faced with conflicting resolution sources?</p>",2015-03-14 07:48:58.209530,0,False,False,7336,217,0.0,None,0,7
