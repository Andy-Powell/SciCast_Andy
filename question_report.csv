Possibly the most famous airship, the Hindenburg, was filled with hydrogen that burned in 1937.?? Airships were popular in the early 1900s, but declined in popularity after disasters such as the Hindenburg. Helium is used now making them much safer.</li><li>While large-scale passenger applications were suspended in the mid-1900s, development focused on military applications for surveillance until resource issues diverted R&amp;D funds from airships. However, recently non-defense-related attention returned to airships as low-carbon methods for transporting goods, as carriers for telescopes to scan the skies, and as instrument carriers to measure the atmosphere. Airships have high spatial and temporal resolution, daily to seasonal coverage, and local to regional spatial coverage.</li><li>In Febuary 2014, the Keck Institute for Space Studies published Airships: A New Horizon for Science, a report that reviewed ?the potential of a variety of airships currently operable or under development to serve as observatories and science instrumentation platforms for a range of space, atmospheric and Earth science.? The authors ?found considerable scientific value in both low altitude (&lt; 40 kft) and high altitude (&gt; 60 kft) airships across a wide spectrum of space, atmospheric, and Earth science programs.? Therefore, the authors call for a prize ?for the development of a maneuverable, station-keeping, stratospheric airship, which can stay aloft at an altitude above 65 kft (20 km) for at least a full diurnal cycle (&gt;20 hours) while carrying a science payload of at least 20 kg in mass? as part of a roadmap to stratospheric airship observatories.</li></ul>Links and sources<br><ul><li><a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/09/business/airship-cargo-revolutionize-arctic-transportation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/09/business/airship-cargo-revolutionize-arctic-transportation/</a><br></li><li>Airships: A New Horizon for Science? <a href=""http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf</a></li><li>The flying bum! 300ft-long 'airship' unveiled in Britain is the world's longest aircraft <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-airship-unveiled-UK-hailed-game-changer.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-airship-unveiled-UK-hailed-game-changer.html"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-a...</a></li><li><a href=""http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf"">http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pd"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pd</a></li></ul><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>06/01/2017<h4>Resolution Source</h4><span>Press release or other official announcement from company or research group.<br><br>This question will resolve when an announcement is made or by the resolution date, whichever one comes first.      <br><br></span><h4>Fine Print</h4>An airship can be a rigid, semi-rigid, or non-rigid lighter-than-air vehicles that can generate their own thrust for maneuvers. 1 ton = 2,000 lbs.<br>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,airship lift 60 tons above 20 km,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,0,19,2014-08-31T00:19:42.379Z,1376,2014-09-02T17:57:37.253Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,binary

Cells also develop a stable polarity that enhances chemotaxis.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Chemotaxis bias depends on a network composed of multiple signaling pathways. ?Several years ago, we discovered that chemoattractants activate PI3Ks producing an accumulation of PIP3 at the leading edge of amoebae. ?We now know that this mechanism is conserved in neutrophils and many other types of eukaryotic cells. ?Unregulated production of PIP3, as occurs in cells lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN, causes many ectopic projections and impairs the directional response of migrating cells. ?Thus, localized PIP3 production is an important conserved mechanism mediating chemotactic bias. ?Surprisingly, however, cells lacking PIP3 production can still carry out chemotaxis. ?This indicates that additional pathways act in parallel or redundantly with PIP3.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>?In our search for parallel pathways, we have recently focused on the gene Pianissimo (PiaA), which was derived from an early genetic screen for chemotaxis defects in Dictyostelium. ?PiaA was later shown to be a subunit of target of rapamycin complex 2 (TorC2) and required for phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motifs (HMs) of ACG kinases such as PKB and PKC. We have found that TorC2 is activated at the leading edge of the cell and causes the localized activation of PKBs and phosphorylation of PKB substrates. ?The absence of these phosphorylation events in cells lacking ?PiaA leads to a defect in chemotaxis. ?This pathway acts in parallel with PIP3 to mediate the chemotactic response. ?We are presently assessing whether the TorC2 mechanism is conserved in chemotaxing neutrophils.?</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Our long term goal is a complete description of the network controlling chemotactic behavior. ?We are analyzing combinations of deficiencies to understand interactions among network components and carrying out additional genetic screens to identify new pathways involved in chemotaxis. ?A comprehensive understanding of this fascinating process should lead to control of pathological conditions such as inflammation and cancer metastasis.<br><br></i></div><b>Useful Links</b><br><ul><li><a href=""http://esgweb1.nts.jhu.edu/cellbio/devreotes/members.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link to?</a><a href=""http://esgweb1.nts.jhu.edu/cellbio/devreotes/members.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Devreotes</a><a href=""http://esgweb1.nts.jhu.edu/cellbio/devreotes/members.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">?Lab</a></li><li><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/dictyworldrace2014/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race Official Webpage</a></li><li><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450904579369372368336300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race in the Wall Street Journal</a></li><li>Link to Dicty Live Stream Site (Coming Soon!)</li></ul><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>05/17/14<h4>Resolution Source</h4>This question will be resolved based on reporting by the Official Dicty World Race 2014 live stream website.<h4>Fine Print</h4>The first 500 cells to finish the race will be tracked and grouped by the cell type.

The benefits of being able to automatically translate from one language to another are enormous, but so are the challenges. Structurally, human languages differ in their morphology, semantics, syntax, and grammar. In addition to these structural differences, the prevalence of idiom and the contextually dependent interpretation of meaning also contribute significant difficulty to machine translation (MT).<br><br>In order to support MT research and help advance the state of the art, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) runs the Open Machine Translation Evaluation (OpenMT). Machine translation teams from around the world test their translation technology on a defined set of non-English text sources and the effectiveness of these competing technologies is evaluated. The list of answer choices for this question (see the Make a Forecast tab) is made up of participant teams in the 2012 evaluation, the most recent one completed.<br><br>The 2015 competition will be evaluating Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation, and include evaluation of machine translation of informal text, such as SMS text, as well as recorded conversational text, both of which differ significantly from formal written text. NIST is considering use of 4 metrics to score each team?s translation (BLUE, METEOR, TER, and HyTER) as well as human assessment. These metrics are commonly used in scoring machine translation and depend on such analyses as comparing machine translations to reference translations. Details of the 2015 OpenMT evaluation, including timeline, data used, and evaluation metrics are available in the links below.

With only 3 trades so far, we are considering rewording the question.  Please leave any comments in the Discussion section by 12-FEB.</p><p>In computational complexity theory, the Unique Games Conjecture is a conjecture made by Subhash Khot in 2002. The conjecture postulates that the problem of determining the value of a certain type of game, known as a unique game, has NP-hard algorithmic complexity. It has broad applications in the theory of hardness of approximation. If it is true, then for many important problems it is not only too hard to get an exact solution (as postulated by the P versus NP problem), but also too hard to get a good approximation. There are important implications for constraint satisfaction problems which crop up in a wide variety of disciplines. The conjecture is unusual in that the academic world seems about evenly divided on whether it is true or not.</p><h4>Resolution Criteria</h4><p>Outcome will be resolved ?yes? if the Unique Games Conjectures receives 'majority/universal academic support' according to question moderator. Public, open source materials to serve as a ""question judge"" may be previously identified by an SME (e.g., 'STOC' and/or 'FOCS' or a publicly circulated preprint that a supermajority of practicing theoretical computer scientists acknowledge the conjectures truth, etc.). Outcome will be resolved based on the question moderator's judgment, after reviewing previously identified open source materials, at the time of question resolution. If no significant changes in academic support have been reported by the date in question, then the ""status quo"" outcome typically will be assumed (i.e., the academic community remains divided as to the conjecture's truth).

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 4 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 4 is comprised of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br></span><span><span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 4 is 1.9%.</span> In the event the start occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</span><br>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Region 4 Flu Start,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,0,17,2014-10-07T15:31:21.267Z,1459,2014-10-07T15:40:04.697Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

Optimization problems are a key part of a wide range of fields from the simplicity of the traveling salesman problem, to the complexity of machine learning.? As useful as it would be, constructing a quantum computer is no easy task. To be a quantum computer three properties must be present: superposition, coherence, and entanglement.? That is, a pair of quantum bits or qubits in the computer must individually be able to hold both a one and a zero with complimentary probability, this probability for each qubit must vary in time with the other half of the pair or qubits, and when the qubits? probabilities are resolved the results for each qubit must be different.</span>  <span><br><br>One of the major players in the field of quantum computing, a small Canadian company named D-Wave, claimed that it had successfully created a quantum processor in 2007.?

However, researchers also found that the qubits are only around half entangled even in smaller groupings, suggesting that their full size 512-qubit system is even less entangled.? In addition, the qubits are arranged in a very specific and more limiting arrangement. ?Taken together, this implies that, while their system possesses a large number of qubits, it can only calculate as though it possesses a fraction of the true amount.? D-Wave?s next challenge is increasing the entanglement of their system or finding a way to create a large enough qubit system that the low percent level of utilization in their system is no longer relevant.</span>  <span><br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, Google has hired John Martinis to make their own version of the D-Wave chip.?

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 6 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 6 is comprised of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%. <br><span><br>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 6 is 3.3%.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.<br><br>The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 1 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 1 is comprised of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. <br><br>ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><span><br>The baseline value for the </span><span>2014-15 influenza season in Region 1 is 1.2%.<br><br></span>?In the event the end occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.<br>",None,2014-10-14 21:08:28.954634,None,943,assumptive_dependency,None,None,942,None,None,None,Region 1 Flu End,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,2,2014-09-30T21:06:24.148Z,1441,2014-10-06T15:33:10.121Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

The current sardine population crash mirrors similar crashes in Pacific sardine populations in the 1950s and 1980s. Sardines are sensitive to temperature shifts ? they prefer warmer water ? and they are believed to be profoundly impacted by a phenomenon called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a decades-long warm and cool cycle in the North Pacific. However, the PDO is not fully understood (it was only identified in 1997) and it can only partly explain the current crash in sardine populations. <br><br>From 2006 to 2012, commercial landings of the Pacific sardine were relatively unaffected by the population decline, with annual catches falling within the range of 138,000 to 165,000 metric tons. However, the 2013 U.S. commercial catch was the lowest in over a decade at an estimated 112,296 metric tons, with U.S. fishermen failing to meet the allowed sardine catch quota. In British Columbia, Canadian fishermen report that their fishery collapsed entirely in 2013. <br><br>Because of concerns over the impact of fishing on the already stressed sardine population, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has reduced the allowable U.S. Pacific catch by 70 percent from January through June 2014 ? from 18,073 metric tons during that period last year to 5,446 metric tons this year.

As Russo and Williamson (2007) point out in the context of the medical literature causal does not imply that a factor is necessary or sufficient for the development of a disease. Rather it may, in its very least, be taken to mean that a susceptible population when exposed to the causative agent/variable in question will be more likely to develop a given disease than a non-exposed population. Moreover, this increased risk should be a result of the action of the factor itself and not the result of some other factor that varies directly with our presumptive causative agent (dependent variable) and disease status (independent variable) ie. it should not be the result of a confounding factor. As Fletcher and Fletcher (2012) state 'It (the case for causation) rests primarily on the research designs used to establish it.' The gold standard is a well designed randomised placebo controlled, double blinded (where both researchers, medical staff and participants are unaware of exposure status) trial. In theory randomisation means that known and unknown variables will be equally distributed in each group and therefore will have no bearing on the outcomes of participants. However, these trials are expensive and are practically difficult to conduct.

The NFL hopes these changes lead to fewer of the type of hits most commonly associated with concussions (such as helmet-to-helmet hits) and to less-severe hits, and ultimately to fewer concussions. Preliminary data indicate these changes have resulted in fewer concussions, though it is too early to be sure.<br> <br> In its annual Super Bowl Health &amp; Safety press conference, the NFL reported 228 concussions sustained in the 2013 season, versus 261 in 2012 and 252 in 2011. These data are for the 20 games of the 4-game preseason and the 16-game regular season. The NFL also reported 90 helmet-to-helmet concussions sustained in the 2013 season, versus 117 in 2012, again across a twenty-game season.</span>  <br><br>More information can be found here:<br><br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633299"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633299</a></li><li><a href=""http://thejns.org/doi/full/10.3171/2014.1.JNS13916"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://thejns.org/doi/full/10.3171/2014.1.JNS13916</a><br></li><li><a href=""http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hs-press-conference.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hs-press-conference.pdf</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2014/01/30/number-of-concussions-down-13-percent-this-season-according-to-nfl-injury-data/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2014/01/30/number-of-concussions-down-13-per...</a></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/31/2015</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Near the date of the 2015 Superbowl the NFL will publish its Super Bowl  Health &amp; Safety report for the 2014 season, which report the number  and type of concussions received during the 20 game per- and regular  season for 2014.

Instead of estimating the chance of a particular outcome, you are asked to forecast the actual expected value, in natural units.  Forecasts moving the estimate towards the actual value will be rewarded. Those moving it away will be penalized.  As with probability questions, moving towards the extremes is progressively more expensive: we have merely rescaled the usual 0%-100% range and customized the interface.  Should the actual value fall outside the question range, the question will resolve at the nearest extreme.  Note that it would take infinite points to move the forecast exactly to that extreme, just as it would take infinite points to move exactly to 0% or 100%.More information on Scaled questions can be found on the SciCast Blog: <a href=""http://blog.scicast.org/2014/06/23/scaled-continuous-question/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.scicast.org/2014/06/23/scaled-continuous-question/</a></p>","{""sig_dig"":""0"",""min"":150,""max"":350,""range"":[150,350],""label"":"""",""stepSize"":""1"",""prefix"":"""",""transformation"":""linear"",""bins"":[{""values"":[150,181],""label"":""\""Between 150 and 180\""""},{""values"":[181,211],""label"":""\""Between 181 and 210\""""},{""values"":[211,241],""label"":""\""Between 211 and 240\""""},{""values"":[241,271],""label"":""\""Between 241 and 270\""""},{""values"":[271,301],""label"":""\""Between 271 and 300\""""},{""values"":[301,330],""label"":""\""Between 301 and 330\""""}],""suffix"":""""}",,,,,,,,None,None,None,NFL concussions,,17,randazzese,38,randazzese,,17,randazzese,38,randazzese,0,24,2014-07-31T17:03:42.103Z,1304,2014-08-12T14:04:13.449Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,binary

In 2012, then-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi said Japan would phase out nuclear power entirely by 2030. Prior to 2011, Japan?s nuclear reactors provided about 30 percent of the electricity generation in the country, but with its reactors now sitting idle Japan has had to turn to coal, oil and natural gas to meet its energy needs. This led to Japan experience its first trade deficit in three decades in 2011 because Japan has very few domestic fuel resources. In 2012, Japan was second only to China in global fossil fuel imports.<br><br>?Current prime minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese utilities are now pushing to get the nation's reactors up and running again, with the prime minister singling out reducing soaring fuel costs as a key plank of his economic reform plans. However, restarting each of the 50+ idling reactors in Japan could cost around $1 billion in fees and will require a six-month review under the new stricter safety regulations put in place since Fukushima.

It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, quantum communication is currently limited to distances of around 100 kilometers because the photons used in quantum communication tend to be absorbed by the glass in fiber-optic cables and by the atmosphere when beamed from one location to another. <br><br>One method to overcome this limitation is to send photons to an orbiting satellite, which would then retransmit the message securely when it is over another part of the planet. This is possible because the photons traveling straight up only have to negotiate a few tens of kilometers of the atmosphere before reaching space.<br><br>There are currently no satellites in the world capable of of producing coherent photons that can carry quantum information. However, there have been recent several experiments that have proven that quantum communication to space and back is indeed possible. In 2013, a Chinese team successfully reflected individual photons off an orbiting satellite to simulate a satellite sending photons to the ground. In June 2014, a group of researchers from the University of Padova conducted a similar experiment and proved that the error rate can be made low enough for quantum cryptography to work.<br><br>China has announced plans to launch a spacecraft in 2016 called the Chinese Quantum Science Satellite designed to test these concepts, though not much is known about its capabilities. European scientists have proposed a quantum communications experiment that could be sent to the international space station. A private Canadian firm called Com Dev also has announced plans to launch a low-cost microsatellite capable of quantum key distribution in the near future.<br><br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528671/the-space-based-quantum-cryptography-race/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528671/the-space-based-quantum-cryptography-race/"">MIT Technology Review - The Space-Based Quantum Cryptography Race</a></li><li><a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/satellites/commercial-quantum-cryptography-satellites-coming"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/satellites/commercial-quantum-cryptography-satellites-coming"">IEEE Spectrum - Commercial Quantum Cryptography Satellites Coming</a></li><li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution"">Wikipedia - Quantum Key Distribution</a><br></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/01/2018</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Quantum cryptography is a technology with enormous potential value, and breakthroughs in quantum communication will likely be covered by a wide variety of science and technology sources, like Science Magazine, MIT Technology Review and others, as well as mainstream news sources.<br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>For this question to be resolved, the satellite equipment in question must be able to send and receive photons containing quantum data from space.</p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,First quantum key distribution satellite,,,,41,danielquerejazu,,31,christinafreyman,41,danielquerejazu,0,20,2014-07-01T15:03:34.141Z,1204,None,None,,,,,multi

The problem is most acute in football, where collisions involving the head are common. New research, sponsored in part by the National Football League (NFL), is evaluating how helmet construction affects the likelihood of sustaining a concussion, and also how the location of and type of head hits affects this likelihood. Helmut construction has been evaluated using accelerometers placed in helmets during live games, and location impacts have been assessed by reviewing game footage of hits that have caused concussions.<br><br><span>The data collected during this research, published respectively in the journals <i>Neurosurgery </i>and <i>Journal of Neurosurgery</i>, are leading to changes in (a) the helmets used by the NFL and to (b) NFL rules regarding how players can use their helmets during collisions with other players. The NFL hopes these changes lead to fewer of the type of hits most commonly associated with concussions (such as helmet-to-helmet hits) and to less-severe hits, and ultimately to fewer concussions. Preliminary data indicate these changes have resulted in fewer concussions, though it is too early to be sure.<br> <br> In its annual Super Bowl Health &amp; Safety press conference, the NFL reported 228 concussions sustained in the 2013 season, versus 261 in 2012 and 252 in 2011.

Instead of estimating the chance of a particular outcome, you are asked to forecast the actual expected value, in natural units. Forecasts moving the estimate towards the actual value will be rewarded. Those moving it away will be penalized. As with probability questions, moving towards the extremes is progressively more expensive: we have merely rescaled the usual 0%-100% range and customized the interface.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 7 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 7 is comprised of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%. <br><br><span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 7 is 1.7%.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 4 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 4 is the highest. Region 4 is comprised of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-14 23:59:50.325837,None,957,assumptive_dependency,None,None,958,None,None,None,Region 4 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T15:31:24.356Z,1460,None,None,,,,,multi

The team builds on earlier theories about using radio wave  observations to discover exoplanets, but applies it in a new way. They  focus on Io and its ionosphere, a charged upper atmosphere that is  likely created by the moon?s extremely active volcanoes. During  its orbit, Io?s ionosphere interacts with Jupiter?s magnetosphere, a  layer of charged plasma that protects the planet from radiation, to  create a frictional current that causes radio wave emissions.

RL is the class of decision problems solvable by a randomized Turing machine with logarithmic space and polynomial time, such that the machine accepts with probability ?1/2 if the answer is ""yes,"" and with probability 0 if the answer is ""no.""  (If we don't impose the condition of polynomial time, then we get the possibly-larger class NL.)  It's clear that L is a subset of RL; this question asks whether the two classes are equal.    L vs. RL is one of the main frontier open problems in the theory of derandomization.</p><p>Today, many complexity theorists conjecture that L=RL, because this conclusion is known to follow from the existence of ""good enough"" pseudorandom generators.  Saks and Zhou proved that RL (and even the ""larger"" class BPL) are contained in deterministic (log n)<sup>3/2</sup> space, improving the (log n)<sup>2</sup> bound that follows from Savitch's Theorem.  Meanwhile, in 2005 Reingold proved that L=SL, where SL is an important subclass of RL corresponding to search on undirected graphs:    [<a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~/reingold/publications/sl.ps?"" rel=""nofollow"">PS</a>]    For a more recent discussion of the L vs. RL problem, see for example:    <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~/reingold/publications/regular.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">this piece</a> (also by Reingold).</p><p>A proof of L=RL would almost certainly consist of a deterministic logspace simulation of RL, together with its analysis (though a nonconstructive proof is theoretically possible).    Since RL is contained in P, a proof of L?RL would require proving L?P as a first step, considered an enormous breakthrough in complexity theory.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 2 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 2 is comprised of New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.<br><br>For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for the U.S. is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across all HHS regions (i.e., across the continental U.S.) is the highest.<br><br>ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br>In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.",None,2014-10-14 21:07:43.129000,None,925,assumptive_dependency,None,None,927,None,None,None,National Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,1,12,2014-09-16T16:43:45.735Z,1411,2014-09-29T19:31:51.296Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

The latter won  the Candidates Tournament in April 2014 to qualify for the next World  Chess Championship to be held in Sochi, Russia, from the 7th until the  28th of November 2014. A variety of news sources are expected to monitor  the match with immediate updates as the match evolves. <br><br><b>Helpful Links:</b><br></span></p><ul><li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2013"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2013"">Recap of the 2013 Championship Match</a><br></li><li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship"">Wiki: World Chess Championship</a></li><li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wiki: FIDE</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.chessbase.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ChessBase</a><br></li><li><a target=""_blank"">Chess.com</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.fide.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Chess Federation</a></li></ul><br><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>11/25/2014</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>The resolution will be determined by the final score of the match, including any potential tie-break.<br><a href=""http://www.chessbase.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.chessbase.com</a><br><a href=""http://www.chess.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.chess.com</a><br><a href=""http://www.fide.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.fide.com</a> <br></p>",None,,,,,,,,2014-12-04 11:12:31.858946,1.0,"[0, 1]",Carlsen vs. Anand 2014,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,0,19,2014-08-19T15:30:22.683Z,1337,None,None,,,,,binary

Polish mathematician Waclaw Franciszek Sierpinski proved that there are infinitely many odd integers k which have this property. The sequence of currently known Sierpinski numbers begins with: 78557, 271129, 271577, 322523? The number 78557 was proved to be a Sierpinski number by John Selfridge in 1962.<br><br>To prove that 78557 is the smallest Sierpinski number, one must show that all the odd numbers smaller than 78557 are not Sierpinski numbers. That is, for every odd k below 78,557 there exists a positive integer n such that k*2^n + 1 is prime. In 2002 a distributed computing project called Seventeen or Bust was established to solve the so-called ?Sierpinski problem,? the problem of ruling out all remaining Sierpinski candidates below 78557. At the time there were seventeen candidates, hence the project name. As of February 20, 2015, only six candidates remain. Primes have been found for the eleven other original 17 candidates numbers, eliminating them for contention as Sierpinski numbers.<br><br>For more information, see:<br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskisCompositeNumberTheorem.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskisCompositeNumberTheorem.html</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.seventeenorbust.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.seventeenorbust.com/</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X08000462"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X08000462"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X08000462</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X1200265X"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X1200265X"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X1200265X</a></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>12/31/2017</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>The Seventeen or Bust project website (<a href=""http://www.seventeenorbust.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link: http://www.seventeenorbust.com"">www.seventeenorbust.com</a>) announced the discovery of any new prime numbers that eliminate candidate numbers from contention.<br><br>This question will resolve when an announcement is made or by the resolution date, whichever one comes first.<br><br>For additional information about the question resolution process, please see the following post on the SciCast blog: <a href=""http://blog.scicast.org/about/resolution"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://blog.scicast.org/about/resolution</a>.<br></p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Sierpinski number,,17,randazzese,38,randazzese,,17,randazzese,38,randazzese,0,19,2015-02-20T19:04:26.478Z,1790,None,None,,,,,multi

Instead of estimating the chance of a particular outcome, you are asked to forecast the actual expected value, in natural units. Forecasts moving the estimate towards the actual value will be rewarded. Those moving it away will be penalized. As with probability questions, moving towards the extremes is progressively more expensive: we have merely rescaled the usual 0%-100% range and customized the interface. Should the actual value fall outside the question range, the question will resolve at the nearest extreme. Note that it would take infinite points to move the forecast exactly to that extreme, just as it would take infinite points to move exactly to 0% or 100%.","{""sig_dig"":1,""min"":0,""max"":12,""range"":[0,12],""label"":"""",""stepSize"":""0.1"",""prefix"":"""",""transformation"":""linear"",""bins"":[{""values"":[0,1.1],""label"":""1 or fewer""},{""values"":[1.1,2.1],""label"":""2 games""},{""values"":[2.1,3.1],""label"":""3 games""},{""values"":[3.1,4.1],""label"":""4 games""},{""values"":[4.1,5.1],""label"":""5 games""},{""values"":[5.1,6.1],""label"":""6 games""},{""values"":[6.1,7.1],""label"":""7 games""},{""values"":[7.1,8.1],""label"":""8 games""},{""values"":[8.1,9.1],""label"":""9 games""},{""values"":[9.1,10.1],""label"":""10 games""},{""values"":[10.1,11.1],""label"":""11 games""},{""values"":[11.1,12],""label"":""12 games""}],""suffix"":"" games""}",,,,,,,,2014-12-04 11:40:44.800616,1.0,"[0.416666666666667, 0.583333333333333]",Carlsen-Anand match - draws,,,,96,stoper,,30,rfuoco,96,stoper,0,17,2014-09-01T19:47:36.874Z,1380,2014-09-09T18:53:13.988Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,binary

For instance, if the ILL count has been published as 50000, the revised value could be, example, 50000 + 2%(50000) = 51000.</p>","{""sig_dig"":""0"",""min"":250,""max"":251500,""range"":[250,251500],""label"":"""",""stepSize"":""1250"",""prefix"":"""",""transformation"":""linear"",""bins"":[{""values"":[250,1500],""label"":""\""Less than 1,500 cases\""""},{""values"":[1500,10000],""label"":""\""1,500 to 10,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[10000,30000],""label"":""\""10,000 to 30,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[30000,60000],""label"":""\""30,000 to 60,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[60000,90000],""label"":""\""60,000 to 90,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[90000,150000],""label"":""\""90,000 to 150,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[150000,250000],""label"":""\""150,000 to 250,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[250000,251500],""label"":""\""250,000 or more cases\""""}],""suffix"":"" cases""}",2014-10-20 15:35:11.333706,None,979,assumptive_dependency,None,None,1014,None,None,None,Region 8 ILI Case Counts,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,8,2014-10-09T14:24:39.039Z,1502,None,None,,,,,binary

Instead of estimating the chance of a particular outcome, you are asked to forecast the actual expected value, in natural units. Forecasts moving the estimate towards the actual value will be rewarded. Those moving it away will be penalized. As with probability questions, moving towards the extremes is progressively more expensive: we have merely rescaled the usual 0%-100% range and customized the interface. Should the actual value fall outside the question range, the question will resolve at the nearest extreme. Note that it would take infinite points to move the forecast exactly to that extreme, just as it would take infinite points to move exactly to 0% or 100%.

Therefore, the authors call for a prize ?for the development of a maneuverable, station-keeping, stratospheric airship, which can stay aloft at an altitude above 65 kft (20 km) for at least a full diurnal cycle (&gt;20 hours) while carrying a science payload of at least 20 kg in mass? as part of a roadmap to stratospheric airship observatories.</li></ul>Links and sources<br><ul><li>Airships: A New Horizon for Science? <a href=""http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf</a></li><li>The flying bum! 300ft-long 'airship' unveiled in Britain is the world's longest aircraft <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-airship-unveiled-UK-hailed-game-changer.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-a...</a></li><li><a href=""http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pd"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pd</a></li></ul><br><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>06/01/2020</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Press release or other official announcement from company or research group.<br><br>This question will resolve when an announcement is made or by the resolution date, whichever one comes first.      <br><br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>An airship can be a rigid, semi-rigid, or non-rigid lighter-than-air vehicles that can generate their own thrust for maneuvers.</p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Airship prize,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,2,18,2014-08-31T00:16:40.486Z,1374,None,None,,,,,binary

These plans are typically smaller in design, and meant to be operated privately rather than by airlines. Spike Aerospace has unveiled plans to develop a 12-18 person supersonic private jet, indicating availability in 2018. Aerion Corporation is working on a supersonic jet for fewer than 12 people, and plans for flight testing in 2019 and to enter the market in 2021. Other supersonic jets have been proposed, and various national space authorities such as NASA are conducting research on improving supersonic flight technology.<br><br>For more background, see:<br></span><ul><li><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/23/tech/innovation/beyond-concorde-supersonic-flight/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/23/tech/innovation/beyond-concorde-supersonic-flight/</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/grantmartin/2013/10/31/the-worlds-first-supersonic-business-jet-will-fly-in-2021/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.forbes.com/sites/grantmartin/2013/10/31/the-worlds-first-supersonic-business-jet-will-fly...</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/23332/the-return-of-supersonic-flight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/23332/the-return-of-supersonic-flight.html</a><br></li><li><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131024-supersonic-jets-of-the-future"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131024-supersonic-jets-of-the-future"">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131024-supersonic-jets-of-the-future</a></li></ul>The demand for fast business travel is growing dramatically given the increasing globalization of the economy.

The force required to accomplish these tasks comes first and foremost from the highly regulated polymerization of actin monomers into filaments, which in turn can be further organized into more complex arrays by a plethora of accessory proteins. Concomitantly, actin filaments are dissembled into monomers to replenish the actin monomer pool.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>We are employing a combinatory approach of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology and imaging to better understand the molecular basis of a number of fundamental actin-based processes underlying cell motility and the formation of specific cell protrusion such as filopodia or lamellipodia as well as phagocytosis and cell division in Dictyostelium and mammalian cells.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Currently, our research is mainly focused on the molecular machineries required for the formation and disassembly of filopodia. These highly dynamic finger-like protrusions are composed of actin filaments aligned in tight parallel bundles with their fast growing barbed ends pushing against the plasma membrane. ?</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Filopodia are used by many cell types as sensing organs to explore environmental cues, and they have also been implicated in cell motility, zippering of epithelial sheets during morphogenesis as well as in cell-substrate adhesion and the spread of viruses. Notwithstanding with this our knowledge about the molecular inventory of proteins involved and the molecular mechanisms underlying filopodia formation are still incomplete.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Currently, we focus on the characterization of the molecular interplay between formins, Ena/VASP proteins and known accessory proteins during the formation and disassembly to filopodia. Formins nucleate and elongate linear actin filaments and have been shown to play a critical role in the formation of filopodia.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Other factors regulating actin assembly in filopodia, lamellipodia and on the surface of pathogens are Ena/VASP proteins. By analysis of actin assembly by TIRF microscopy on the single filament level we recently showed that both, human and ?Dictyostelium VASP, are directly involved in mediating processive filament elongation by the delivery of actin monomers to growing filament barbed end. Thus, Ena/VASP proteins constitute the second known filament elongators besides formins. A challenging task in the future is to determine the specific contribution of Ena/VASP proteins and formins to nucleation and elongation of filopodial actin filaments.</i></div><br>Useful Links<br><ul><li><a href=""http://www.mh-hannover.de/bpc_dyncyt.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link to?F</a><a href=""http://www.mh-hannover.de/bpc_dyncyt.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aix Lab</a></li><li><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/dictyworldrace2014/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race Official Webpage</a></li><li><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450904579369372368336300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race in the Wall Street Journal</a></li><li>Link to Dicty Live Stream Site (Coming Soon!)</li></ul><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>05/17/14<h4>Resolution Source</h4>This question will be resolved based on reporting by the Official Dicty World Race 2014 live stream website.<h4>Fine Print</h4>The first 500 cells to finish the race will be tracked and grouped by the cell type.

It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, quantum communication is currently limited to distances of around 100 kilometers because photons tend to be absorbed by the glass in fiber-optic cables and by the atmosphere when beamed from one location to another. <br><br>One method to overcome this limitation is to send photons to an orbiting satellite, which would then retransmit the message securely when it is over another part of the planet. This is possible because the photons traveling straight up only have to negotiate a few tens of kilometers of the atmosphere before reaching space.<br><br>There are currently no satellites in the world capable of of producing coherent photons that can carry information. However, there have been recent several experiments that have proven that quantum communication to space and back is indeed possible. In 2013, a Chinese team successfully reflected individual photons off an orbiting satellite, to simulate a satellite sending photons to the ground. In June 2014, a group of researchers from the University of Padova conducted a similar experiment and proved that the error rate? can be made low enough for quantum cryptography to work.<br><br>The race is on to create the first space-based quantum key distribution transmission equipment. Researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China have announced plans to launch a spacecraft in 2016 called the Chinese Quantum Science Satellite designed to test quantum communication concepts, though not much is known about its capabilities. Scientists from Austrian Academy of Sciences and the European Space Agency have proposed a quantum communications experiment that could be sent to the International Space Station. A Canadian firm called Com Dev, working with the Institute for Quantum Computing, has announced plans to launch a low-cost microsatellite capable of quantum key distribution in the near future.<br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528671/the-space-based-quantum-cryptography-race/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528671/the-space-based-quantum-cryptography-race/"">MIT Technology Review - The Space-Based Quantum Cryptography Race?</a></li><li><a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/satellites/commercial-quantum-cryptography-satellites-coming"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/satellites/commercial-quantum-cryptography-satellites-coming"">IEEE Spectrum - Commercial Quantum Cryptography Satellites Coming</a></li><li><a href=""http://english.cas.cn/Ne/CASE/201303/t20130308_99432.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chinese Academy of Sciences - China to Launch Quantum Experiment Satellite in 2016</a></li><li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia - Quantum Key Distribution</a><br></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/01/2018</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Quantum cryptography is a technology with enormous potential value, and breakthroughs in quantum communication will likely be covered by a wide variety of science and technology sources, like Science Magazine, MIT Technology Review and others, as well as mainstream news sources.<br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>For this question to be resolved, the transmission equipment in question must be able to send and receive photons containing quantum data from space.If 2 or more than one of the organizations listed here form a partnership to develop the first operational space-based quantum key distribution transmitter, the question will resolve as a mixture of the organizations.</p>",None,2014-08-17 23:17:09.601470,None,805,assumptive_dependency,None,None,806,None,None,None,Organization quantum key distribution transmitter,,,,41,danielquerejazu,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,0,3,2014-07-01T15:21:14.161Z,1205,None,None,,,,,multi

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 9 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 9 is comprised of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%. <span><br><br>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 9 is 2.7%.

Eliot once wrote, ?Genuine poetry can communicate before it is understood,? and, so it is also with every cell in our body. ?How do cells communicate?? It is a fascinating question that lies at the center of many biological mysteries. Fundamental knowledge of the strategies that cells use to transmit information to their neighbors and their surrounding environment is necessary in order to understand a range of biological processes from immune responses to tissue organization and organogenesis, as well as disease progression, wound healing and regeneration. My research program focuses on investigating the principles of communication between cells as well as between cells and their microenvironment through the study of cell microvesicles. Because of their early dismissal as cellular debris, the study of microvesicles is a very new field. As such, a wide number of fundamental questions remain. Most of the research to date has been in the identification of microvesicle shedding from various normal and disease state cells and in the initial formation and exocytosis of microvesicles from these cells. In contrast, investigations into the uptake of these bodies by recipient cells and the subsequent dissemination of their contents have been limited.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>In my lab, we strive to understand the fundamental pathways involved in the packaging, trafficking, and exocytosis of microvesicles by host cells and the subsequent uptake, trafficking and dissemination of microvesicle cargo by target cells.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>As the manager of the Clemson Light Imaging Facility, I am also interested in developing new imaging techniques for use in a variety of experimental systems and for analysis of advanced materials.</i></div><br>Useful Links<br><ul><li><a href=""http://www.clemson.edu/cafls/departments/biosci/faculty_staff/bruce_t.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link to?T</a><a href=""http://www.clemson.edu/cafls/departments/biosci/faculty_staff/bruce_t.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">erri Bruce Website</a></li><li><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/dictyworldrace2014/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race Official Webpage</a></li><li><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450904579369372368336300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race in the Wall Street Journal</a></li><li>Link to Dicty Live Stream Site (Coming Soon!)</li></ul><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>05/17/14<h4>Resolution Source</h4>This question will be resolved based on reporting by the Official Dicty World Race 2014 live stream website.<h4>Fine Print</h4>The first 500 cells to finish the race will be tracked and grouped by the cell type.

A quantum gate requires interactions between individual quanta, and the discovery of interacting photons offers a possible mechanism for this interaction.<br><br>A quantum gate is a quantum computing circuit operating on qubits, the quantum equivalent to bits in classical computing. Qubits have 2 possible states, just as bits, though unlike bits they can exist in a superimposition of their based states, i.e. more than one state at once. Quantum gates are also reversible, meaning there is a one-to-one mapping between vectors of inputs and outputs .

It will be a few years before we know what the success rate is of phase 2a clinical trials established using this strategy. <br><br>In the initial phase, NCATS funding was awarded to nine projects in 2013, including the investigations of an AstraZeneca Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed for cancer treatment for its therapeutic uses in Alzheimer's disease and Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) treatment.<br></p><ul><li>NIH turns to crowdsourcing to repurpose drugs:?<a href=""http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-nih-crowdsourcing-repurpose-drugs.html#inlRlv"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-nih-crowdsourcing-repurpose-drugs.html#inlRlv</a></li><li><div>The NIH-Industry New Therapeutic Uses Pilot Program: Demonstrating the Power of Crowdsourcing:?<a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/drrr.2014.0006"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/drrr.2014.0006</a></div></li><li>New Therapeutic Uses 2013 Project Awards:?<a href=""http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/reengineering/rescue-repurpose/therapeutic-uses/projects-2013.html#uva"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/reengineering/rescue-repurpose/therapeutic-uses/projects-2013.html...</a></li><li>Project information:?<a href=""http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_results.cfm?aid=8599141&amp;icde=19464013"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_results.cfm?aid=8599141&amp;icde=19464013</a><br></li></ul>?<p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>12/31/2016</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Project information and status can be found in NIH RePORT:?<a href=""http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8599141&amp;icde=19464013"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8599141&amp;icde=19464013</a></p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Repurposing cancer drug to treat LAM,,,,46,JLU_BAE,,392,pthomas524,46,JLU_BAE,0,17,2014-08-22T16:23:20.243Z,1345,None,None,,,,,binary

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 3 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 3 is comprised of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.</span><br><span><span><br>The baseline value for the </span><span>2014-15 influenza season in Region</span> 3 is 2.0%.<br><br>In the event the start occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</span><br>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Region 3 Flu Start,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,0,18,2014-10-07T15:15:32.674Z,1454,2014-10-07T15:19:14.853Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

Some animals, that may look similar to known species, are found to be new species only when scientists have the opportunity to assess their genomes. <br><br><a href=""http://biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3765.2.1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In February 2014, a?new?species?of</a><a href=""http://biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3765.2.1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">?dasyurid?</a><a href=""http://biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3765.2.1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marsupial was described in </a><a href=""http://biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3765.2.1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ZOOTAXA.</a><br><br>For more information, see:<br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/43620-new-species-marsupial-antechinus.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.livescience.com/43620-new-species-marsupial-antechinus.html</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/photos/9-newly-discovered-species/caqueta-monkey"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/photos/9-newly-discovered-species/caqueta-monkey</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/26/tiny-wallaby-among-three-mammals-glimpsed-for-first-time-in-remote-forest"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/26/tiny-wallaby-among-three-mammals-glimpsed-for-first-tim...</a></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>03/31/2015</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>A new mammal species will be reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature - in a journal?<span><span>indexed by Thomson Reuters?

As an example, Raytheon?s Boomerang series provides enemy shooter detection capabilities to forces at the battlefront through their Boomerang Warrior-X, Boomerang Air, and Boomerang III.

Recognising the importance of responding to the climate change challenge, countries all over the world are acting to reduce their emissions. The message is clear: Australia needs to reduce its carbon pollution and do its fair share.In December 2007, Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreeing to limit annual carbon pollution to an average of 108 per cent of 1990 levels during the Kyoto period (2008 to 2012).Australia has also committed to reducing its emissions by between 5 and 15 or 25 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. The five per cent target is unconditional. The up to 15 per cent and 25 per cent targets are conditional on the extent of international action. On 27 January 2010, Australia formally submitted its full target range to the Copenhagen Accord. The decision to maintain the full range is consistent with the approach taken by other countries.The Australian Government has also committed to a long-term target to cut pollution by 80 per cent below 2000 levels by 2050.</p><h4>Resolution Criteria</h4><p>The outcome will be resolved based on the published results of Australia's National Inventory Report which is submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of Australia's reporting obligations under that Convention and the Kyoto Protocol (KP).

Forecasts moving the estimate towards the actual value will be rewarded. Those moving it away will be penalized.  As with probability questions, moving towards the extremes is progressively more expensive: we have merely rescaled the usual 0%-100% range and customized the interface.  Should the actual value fall outside the question range, the question will resolve at the nearest extreme.

Prominent Italian inventor Andrea Rossi received a patent for a device he claimed capable of net energy positive LENR in 2011, which allegedly works by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel powder, transmuting it into copper and producing heat. Rossi has never let anyone see the inner workings of his device, and he refused to allow independent testing of the device until 2013. The researchers who conducted that test of Rossi?s device have written a paper detailing their findings, but it has yet to be published in a peer review journal. NASA is also developing LENR technology in their Langley Research Center using a nickel lattice and hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions are sucked into the nickel lattice, and then the lattice is oscillated at a very high frequency. This oscillation produces a reaction that turns the nickel into copper and creates a lot of energy in the process.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 9 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 9 is the highest. Region 9 is comprised of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-15 00:06:22.943923,None,982,assumptive_dependency,None,None,983,None,None,None,Region 9 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T17:25:22.336Z,1485,None,None,,,,,multi

The most likely candidates for superseding pumped hydro storage are the forms of energy storage that comprise the remaining 5% of energy storage: thermal, battery, compressed air, and flywheel.  </div><br>Thermal energy storage is closely bound to renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy.? It is the practice of storing heat energy in materials such as molten salt during off hours and then using that heat energy to produce steam and turn a turbine during times of high demand.? Naturally, solar energy has a high heat component but other forms of energy production give off ""waste"" heat that could instead be stored with this method.<br><br>The classic method of energy storage is through the use of batteries.? While there are several different types of batteries that might be used for grid level storage, each possible type currently suffers some combination of high cost, poor scalability, short lifespan, and slow discharge rate.? Further advancements might alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks and enhance the benefits.<br><br>Compressed air storage is very similar to pumped hydro storage with the distinction that it is pressure rather than gravitational potential energy that is used to store the energy.? In addition to storing energy, the compression also heats up the air.? Under certain systems this heat is recycled and used to reheat the air during the operation of the energy raising the energy efficiency of this method.? Unfortunately, even with recycled heat energy this method maxes out at around 70% efficiency.<br><br>Flywheels store energy as rotational kinetic energy.? A mass rotates inside a vacuum and as energy is supplied the rpm increase.? To expend energy the process runs the other way, rotational speed is decreased to supply rotation to a turbine that is producing energy.? This form of storage tends to have a very long life span but it can be expensive and scaling up to grid level is still difficult with regards to the materials of the flywheel.<br><br>**Admin Update:?<span>There are no restrictions on the sizes of rated power or the durations for which the storage must operate. Part of the goal with this was to get a sense of where grid level battery storage was headed so every status project will count aside from projects that have been decommissioned. In the interest of accuracy, unverified entries should not be counted.</span><br><br>More information:<br><a href=""http://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/09/f18/Grid%20Energy%20Storage%20December%202013.pdf "" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Energy Overview</a><br><a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/10/new-nrel-report-concentrating-solar-power-adds-value/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/10/new-nrel-report-concentrating-solar-power-adds-value/"">Thermal</a><br><a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurobat.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Feurobat_smartgrid_publication_may_2013_0.pdf&amp;ei=jV4kVNWbFIrGggSawoDoBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNECb0ExVDo0B4Gm5tL7_SDYDWDGEw&amp;bvm=bv.76247554,d.eXY&amp;cad=rja"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurobat.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Feurobat_smartgrid_publication_may_2013_0.pdf&amp;ei=jV4kVNWbFIrGggSawoDoBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNECb0ExVDo0B4Gm5tL7_SDYDWDGEw&amp;bvm=bv.76247554,d.eXY&amp;cad=rja"">Battery</a><br><a href=""http://energystorage.org/compressed-air-energy-storage-caes "" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Compressed Air Storage</a><br><a href=""http://energystorage.org/energy-storage/technologies/flywheels "" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flywheels</a><br><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>12/31/2015<h4>Resolution Source</h4><span>A report on Grid Energy Storage from the Department of Energy or a comparison of the forms of grid level energy storage via the Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database at <a href=""http://www.energystorageexchange.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.energystorageexchange.org/</a>.<br><br>The data will be retrived from the database in Jan 2016 and only data up to 12/31/2015 will be used.<br></span>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Grid level energy storage possibilities,,,,225,dylan.cohen,,31,christinafreyman,225,dylan.cohen,1,20,2014-09-25T19:33:23.360Z,1425,2014-10-08T21:19:29.494Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 8 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 8 is comprised of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<span><br><br>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 8 is 1.3%.

These metrics are commonly used in scoring machine translation and depend on such analyses as comparing machine translations to reference translations. Details of the 2015 OpenMT evaluation, including timeline, data used, and evaluation metrics are available in the links below. Evaluation results for the 2015 evaluation, which is already underway, are expected by the end of January 2015.<br><br>For more background, see:<br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/MachineTranslation.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://research.google.com/pubs/MachineTranslation.html"">http://research.google.com/pubs/MachineTranslation.html</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt.cfm"">http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt.cfm</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt15.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt15.cfm"">http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt15.cfm</a></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>1/31/2015</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p><span>NIST will report the results of its 2015 OpenMT evaluation here:? <a href=""http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt15.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt15.cfm</a></span>  <br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>NIST has not yet indicated which evaluation metrics it will use, so in resolving this question, scores will be considered in this order:  (1) BLUE, (2) METEOR, (3) TER, and (4) HyTER.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 3 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 3 is comprised of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br><span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 3 is 2.0%.<br><br></span>In the event the end occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.<br>",None,2014-10-14 23:58:12.471464,None,953,assumptive_dependency,None,None,954,None,None,None,Region 3 Flu End,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T15:15:41.116Z,1456,2014-10-07T15:26:11.589Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

Dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium</div><div>In order to analyze the dynamics of the actin filament system cells, we express fluorescent fusion proteins as specific probes for the actin cytoskeletonin Dictyostelium and use different microscopic techniques to explore these cells. We also investigate different actin regulators like for instance the actin-binding proteins coronin and Aip1 (actin-interacting protein 1). We have characterized the in vivo functions of these two regulators, and have shown that coronin and Aip1 are important for maintaining the balance of actin filament dynamics and the spatiotemporal control of actin turnover. Furthermore, we are interested in the functional characterization of nuclear actin-related proteins (Arps) and actin variants.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Regulation of cytokinesis in Dictyostelium</div><div>Cell division is a well-coordinated process that involves mitosis bringing about division of the genetic material, followed by cleavage of the cell body. Our work aims at a more detailed understanding of these processes in particular the role of the cytoskeleton and the regulatory components.

In addition, we have described a SIN (septation initiation network)-homologous pathway which is involved in cytokinesis in Dictyostelium.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Fluorescent probes for live cell imaging studies in Dictyostelium</div><div>The introduction of fluorescent proteins as molecular tags has opened a wide field of applications in order to monitor the location, redistribution, and movement of proteins in living cells. GFP and its variants can be fused to many proteins without altering their intrinsic functions. Over the past years, we have developed a number of different probes that are suitable for live cell imaging studies.</div><div><br></div><div>4. Cytoskeletal dynamics in migrating leukocytes and Dictyostelium amoebae</div><div>Directed migration of leukocytes or Dictyostelium amoebae requires a finely tuned organization of the cytoskeleton. To analyze this in more detail, we exploit the wealth of data available from Dictyostelium mutants to understand the motile behavior of leukocytes at the cell biological, biochemical and structural level. The focus is on filamins and formins, two important protein classes in the actin system, and their roles in both amoebae and leukocytes. Filamins and formins are major players especially in leukocyte motility, chemotactic movement, cell polarity, cell spreading and adhesion. In particular, we are interested in filamin and formin binding partners and the analysis of inter-cytoskeletal interactions (e.g. filamin/actin/vimentin, formin/actin/microtubules) in leukocytes. Furthermore, we employ different types of microfluidic devices for the detailed analysis of directed cell migration of Dictyostelium amoebae and leukocytes under different conditions.

At those levels, the US is the world's largest supplier of commercial nuclear power. The United States also has the 4th largest uranium reserves in the world. The uranium mining process mixes uranium ore with groundwater, creating a solution which is filtered and dried to produce uranium oxide concentrate of the chemical formula U3O8. The vast majority of nuclear power reactors require enriched uranium fuel in which the proportion of the uranium-235 isotope has been raised from the natural level of 0.7% to between 3.5% to 5%. Modern enrichment plants use a centrifuge process to create enriched uranium, which is turned into uranium dioxide (UO2) powder.

However, the BICEP team apparently interpreted the map as showing only the galactic emissions. In reality, it may also contain the largely unpolarized hazy glow from other galaxies, which has the effect of making the galactic microwaves coming from any particular point of the sky look less thoroughly polarized than they actually are. So using the map to strip out the galactic foreground may actually leave some of that foreground in the data where it could produce a spurious signal, Falkowski explains. ""Apparently, there is something that needs to be corrected, so at this point the BICEP result cannot be taken at face value,"" he tells Science.</a><br><br><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/05/blockbuster-big-bang-result-may-fizzle-rumor-suggests?"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BICEP researchers are not ready to concede the point, however. Clement Pryke, a cosmologist at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and a co-principal investigator for the BICEP team, acknowledges that the foreground map is an important and thorny issue. Part of the problem is that the Planck team has not made the raw foreground data available, he says. Instead, BICEP researchers had to do the best they could with a PDF file of that map that the Planck team presented at a conference. Moreover, Pryke says, conversations with members of the Planck team leave it uncertain exactly what is in the key plot. ""It is unclear what that plot shows,"" he says.</a><br></blockquote><br><b>Links and sources</b><br>Blockbuster Big Bang Result May Fizzle, Rumor Suggests<br><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/05/blockbuster-big-bang-result-may-fizzle-rumor-suggests?ref=em"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/05/blockbuster-big-bang-result-may-fizzle-rumor-suggests?</a><br><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>12/31/2014</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Like the first announcement, a retraction will be covered by the Science section of the New York Times as well as science journals such as Nature and Science.<br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>Retract ? an official from the original group that announced the observation will announce that a mistake was made and that they retract their findings they announced in March of 2014.</p>",None,,,,,,,,2015-01-12 12:27:22.538779,0.0,"[1, 0]",Retraction of primordial gravitational waves,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,0,18,2014-05-15T13:50:04.517Z,1057,2014-05-16T18:26:46.705Z,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,binary

One of these pathways involves Wnt/wingless signaling and includes 7-transmembrane (7-TM) target receptors and a downstream effector, the protein kinase, GSK3. In Dictyostelium, stimulation of a family of 7-TM receptors by its ligand, the secreted chemoattractant/morphogen, cAMP, also establishes a fundamental developmental organization, the anterior/posterior axis. We have shown that different cAMP receptor subtypes act antagonistically to promote or to inhibit cell-specific differentiation and axis formation. These antagonistic pathways converge at GSK3 in the context of cell fate determination. The latter inhibitory pathway parallels Wnt/wingless signaling through the 7-span frizzled receptors to control GSK3 activity and axes formation in Drosophila, Xenopus, and other metazoa. Separately, we have identified a novel tyrosine kinase, ZAK1, that is required for receptor-mediated activation of GSK3 during development, and have shown that recombinant ZAK1 will phosphorylate and consequently activate mammalian GSK3 in vitro. Remarkably, this 7-TM receptor-dependent activation of GSK3 may act independently of G proteins. These studies may reveal new mechanisms involving protein tyrosine kinases that are critical for cell fate specification or tumor suppression in other systems.</i><br><br>Useful Links<br><ul><li><a href=""http://irp.nih.gov/pi/alan-kimmel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link to?Kimmel Lab</a></li><li><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/dictyworldrace2014/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race Official Webpage</a></li><li><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450904579369372368336300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race in the Wall Street Journal</a></li><li>Link to Dicty Live Stream Site (Coming Soon!)</li></ul><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>05/17/14<h4>Resolution Source</h4>This question will be resolved based on reporting by the Official Dicty World Race 2014 live stream website.<h4>Fine Print</h4>The first 500 cells to finish the race will be tracked and grouped by the cell type.

The question asks whether this problem is solvable in P -- i.e., by a deterministic algorithm, running on a conventional computer (Turing machine), that always uses a number of steps upper-bounded by a polynomial in n.  </p> <p>There is a tremendous amount known about graph isomorphism, stemming from 35+ years of research.  For example, algorithms are known that almost always succeed in practice (leading some researchers to conjecture that graph isomorphism is in P); numerous special cases of the problem have been proved to be in P; and the general problem has been shown be solvable in ~2<sup>?n</sup> time (or ~2<sup>n<sup>1/3</sup></sup> time for regular graphs).  On the other hand, counterexamples have also been designed that foil many of the ""obvious"" strategies for solving the general problem in P.  Finally, in complexity theory, it's known that graph isomorphism has a Statistical Zero-Knowledge protocol, which implies that the problem *cannot* be NP-complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.</p> <p> It's impossible even to provide an adequate survey here, but one starting point is the Wikipedia article:    <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism</a>.    A proof that graph isomorphism is in P would almost certainly consist of an algorithm together with its analysis (though a nonconstructive proof is theoretically possible).  A claim that some algorithm ""always works in practice"" will not count for resolving this bet (though it could, of course, shift the odds); only rigorous proofs will be considered.    Since the graph isomorphism problem is in NP, to prove that the problem is NOT in P, a prerequisite would be to prove P?NP.  A proof that graph isomorphism is NP-complete, or some other conditional hardness result, will not count for resolving this bet (though again, it could certainly shift the odds).    Finally, the design of a randomized or quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism (i.e., proof that the problem is in BPP or BQP) will not count for resolving this particular bet.    A proof that the answer is independent of the ZF axioms will be considered to resolve the bet.

'Estimated vaccination coverage' is a termed defined by the CDC as the estimated number of people who have received a particular vaccine. In this instance, 2013 HPV estimated vaccination coverage describes the estimated number of people who have received at least one single dose of HPV vaccine according to the CDC's 2014 National Immunization Survey (NIS) - Teen. Previous annual rates have been reported to the 0.1%. The range in possible answer bins will be treated as half-open intervals, such that the first number is included in the range. For example if the estimated vaccination coverage is 38.8%, the ""38.8%-42.2%"" range will be deemed correct.</p>","{""sig_dig"":1,""min"":15,""max"":85,""prefix"":"""",""label"":"""",""stepSize"":""0.2"",""range"":[15,85],""transformation"":""linear"",""bins"":[{""values"":[0,28.4],""label"":""Down ~12% or more""},{""values"":[28.4,31.9],""label"":""Down ~10%""},{""values"":[31.9,35.3],""label"":""Down ~7%""},{""values"":[35.3,38.8],""label"":""Down ~3%""},{""values"":[38.8,42.2],""label"":""Within ~2% of Baseline""},{""values"":[42.2,45.7],""label"":""Up ~3%""},{""values"":[45.7,49.1],""label"":""Up ~7%""},{""values"":[49.1,52.6],""label"":""Up ~10%""},{""values"":[52.6,100],""label"":""Up ~12% or more""}],""suffix"":""%""}",2014-04-27 13:46:17.783620,None,546,assumptive_dependency,None,None,494,2014-08-05 11:28:56.024568,1.0,"[0.4557, 0.5443]",2013 HPV vaccination coverage - MS,,18,jbeauregard,7,jbeauregard,,6,Question Mark,12,mjaster,0,2,2014-04-09T16:48:13.630Z,882,2014-04-14T03:31:12.907Z,,6,Question Mark,12,mjaster,binary

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 10 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 10 is comprised of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br></span><br><span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 10 is 1.1%.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 4 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 4 is comprised of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%. <span><br><br>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 4 is 1.9%.

Here, the ""allowed operations"" are to take products and affine combinations over F; these operations can be combined into an arbitrary circuit, which must have n<sup>2</sup> outputs corresponding to the entries of C.  The circuit can be completely different for each input size n, in a nonuniform manner; on the other hand, the same circuit must work for an arbitrary field F (though it need not work for rings). </p><p>Let S(n) be the size of the smallest such circuit for multiplication of two n*n matrices.  Then this question is asking whether S(n)=O(n<sup>2+?</sup>) for every constant ?&gt;0.    Equivalently, let ? (the ""matrix multiplication exponent"") be the infimum over all c such that S(n)=O(n<sup>c</sup>); then this question is asking whether ?=2. </p><p>The obvious upper bound, ?=3, was improved by a long sequence of algorithms, starting with that of Strassen in 1968 (??2.78).  The current record, ??2.373, was proved by Vassilevska Williams, building in part on work of Stothers (both of whom were building on the important 1990 result ??376, due to Coppersmith and Winograd):    [<a href=""http://www.cs.stanford.edu/~virgi/matrixmult-f.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF</a>]    </p><p>Meanwhile, the only lower bound known remains the ""obvious"" bound ??2, which comes from the fact that any matrix multiplication circuit must have n<sup>2</sup> inputs and n<sup>2</sup> outputs.  (Indeed, for general algorithms, we know nothing better than S(n)?c*n<sup>2</sup>, though Ran Raz proved S(n)?c*n<sup>2</sup>*log(n) for a restricted class of algorithms.)    Opinion on the question remains divided: some theoretical computer scientists profess belief that ?=2, but an ambitious program to prove that, due to Umans, Kleinberg, et al., has not (yet) panned out.  Thus, at present, there is no clear proposal for what an algorithm achieving ?=2 would look like.</p><p>A ""yes"" answer to this question would consist of a rigorous proof that ?=2.  It is plausible that such a proof would involve at least some nonconstructive elements, and this is perfectly acceptable.    A ""no"" answer would consist of a rigorous proof that ??2.  Since, at present, we lack the techniques for proving such circuit lower bounds, such a proof would be considered an enormous breakthrough in complexity theory.    A proof that the answer is independent of the ZF axioms will be considered to resolve the bet.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 6 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 6 is comprised of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%. </span><span><br><br>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 6 is 3.3%.

Despite the first case being discovered in 2012, little is known about how the virus spreads to people from animal hosts. However, it is known that the virus spreads from human to human. In addition, bats and camels have been found to be infected with MERS. ??So far, all the cases have been linked to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula through residence in or travel to, indicating that modes of transmission outside of the Arabian Peninsula are through travel. Since April 2012,?lab-confirmed cases from the following countries have been identified:<br></p><ul><li>France </li><li>Italy </li><li>Jordan </li><li>Kuwait </li><li>Oman </li><li>Qatar </li><li>Saudi Arabia </li><li>Tunisia </li><li>United Kingdom (UK)</li><li>United Arab Emirates (UAE) ? <br></li></ul>No cases have been identified in Egypt yet. ??<br><br>??This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact. Travel has been the primary way in which MERS-CoV has spread to people outside the Middle East.? This suggests that human infection of MERS-CoV to Egypt will most likely be a result of travel. On 10 November 2013, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia announced the detection of MERS- CoV in a specimen taken from an ill camel owned by a laboratory - confirmed case from Jeddah. This case had direct contact with the ill camel. ??<br><br>It may be likely that MERS has already spread to more countries, but has not been detected due to lack of knowledge or access to testing. However, in Sept 2013 the MERS gene was mapped and in Dec 2013, a group published a paper on their development of isothermal real-time RT-RPA, which they claim is ideal for rapid mobile molecular MERS-CoV monitoring. Therefore, it is more likely than ever that a case will be detected in the next 6 months. <br><br><a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0299_article.htm "" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chu et al</a> found MERS RNA in four camels in Egypt that had been imported from Sudan and Ethiopia. <br><br>Sources and references:<br><ul><li><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/vietnam-on-high-alert-over-flu-risk-1.14764"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vietnam on high alert over flu risk</a></li><li><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/02/middle-eastern-virus-more-widespread-thought"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Middle Eastern Virus More Widespread Than Though</a>t </li><li><a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0299_article.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MERS Coronaviruses in Dromedary Camels, Egypt</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The World Health Organization on Coronavirus infections</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/Update12_MERSCoV_update_22Nov13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WHO update on MERS-CoV</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/MERS/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CDC MERS information</a></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>10/01/2014</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p><span>WHO update on MERS-CoV: <a href=""http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections</a></span><br><span>CDC MERS information: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/"">http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/</a></span><br>CDC GDD program: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/gdder/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/gdder/"">http://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/gdder/</a></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>Lab-confirmed: as announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>",None,,,,,,,,2014-05-02 11:09:12.590713,1.0,"[0.0, 1.0]",MERS in Egypt by OCT-2014,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,,1016,tennant,93,tennant,0,5,2014-03-12T01:07:04.645Z,737,2014-03-23T23:26:38.285Z,,6,Question Mark,12,mjaster,binary

Yetit is also obvious that much health and well-being advice on the net is bogus.The argument can thus be made that there should be a safe top-level Internetdomain name for reliable health information, where it would not be possible topost fraudulent claims of cures or ill-conceived, dogmatic advice on health. Thereis a lively debate going on around this serious public interest issue,occasioned by a major recent development.<br><span><br>The reason forthe debate is a decision by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names andNumbers (ICANN) to expand the range of global or generic top-level domains(gTLDs). ICANN is a largely self-referential body concerned with governance ofthe Internet, especially the allocation of gTLD names to organizations that bidto manage them. It was in the news recently when the US government announcedthat it would relinquish its special relationship with ICANNso as to avoid the impression that governance of the internet might be in thehands of one government. ICANN iscurrently proposing to allocate about a dozen health-related gTLDs, including?.doctor?, ?.nurse?, ?.hospital?, and others. For some of these, a websiteusing the relevant extension would have to be owned by an appropriatelyqualified person or organization: to be ?someone.doctor?, someone would have toshow that they are accredited as a physician (compare ?.edu? for educationalinstitutions). However, this principle has not been extended to all domains.<br></span><span><br>Mostcontroversial among the new gTLDs is the domain ?.health?, which, as thingsstand, is poised to be awarded to one of three commercially-oriented bidderswho seem to have little or no track record or expertise in healthcare, or anycommitment to public health. Despite this, ICANN does not consider it necessaryto not impose any further restriction or qualification on the use of ?.health?,so whoever gets control of it would be free to license its use by anyone, nomatter how irrelevant or misleading. This would evidently be subject to abuse. It is expensive both to apply for and tomaintain a gTLD ($185,000 non-returnable up front and $25,000 per annum) sothat commercial pressure will bias domain controllers not to discriminate toomuch on who is allowed to use it ? provided they are willing to pay enough.<br></span><span><br><b></b>ICANN posts Information about the process ofallocation of the "".health"" domain name at <a href=""http://icannwiki.com/index.php/.health"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://icannwiki.com/index.php/.health</a>. None of the three candidates appears tohave the necessary competence, or be prepared to seek a partner who has, tosafeguard health information on the net. The World Health Organization (WHO)bid for the ?.health? gTLD in 2000, when ICANN decided to postpone award of thedomain. The WHO has since been discouraged, arguably blocked, by a minority of influentialmember governments from bidding for the domain name again. Senior officerswithin the WHO have been frustrated by restrictions even to voicing theirobjections to the three current proposals. There is a good case to be made thatthe allocation of this gTLD should be postponed until questions about its usehave been explored and safeguards against its abuse have been put in place.</span></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>12/31/2014</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>The next meeting of ICANN is set to take place in London in the week of June 22nd, 2014.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 10 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 10 is the highest. Region 10 is comprised of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-15 00:07:10.587853,None,987,assumptive_dependency,None,None,988,None,None,None,Region 10 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T17:39:38.426Z,1490,None,None,,,,,multi

In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 1 is comprised of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. <br><br>ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br>The baseline value for the </span><span>2014-15 influenza season in Region 1 is 1.2%. <br><br>In the event the start occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</span><br>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Region 1 Flu Start,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,None,sherilyn,20,sgravett,0,1,2014-09-30T21:05:49.715Z,1439,2014-10-06T15:26:43.122Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

In 2012, coal-fired generation dropped by 12.3 percent, while gas-fired electricity production increased by 20.4 percent.<br><br><img alt="""" src=""http://www.technologyreview.com/sites/default/files/images/annual.changex519.png"" title=""Image: http://www.technologyreview.com/sites/default/files/images/annual.changex519.png""><br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport.html"">EPA - National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527106/how-and-why-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-falling/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527106/how-and-why-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-falling/"">MIT Technology Review - Natural Gas Fuels Recent Drop in U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</a><br></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/04/2015</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>The EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for 2013 will be released in April of 2015 and can be found here: <a href=""http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport.html"">National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data</a><br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>The answer will be rounded to the nearest tenth decimal point for resolution. </p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,2013 US greenhouse gas emissions,,,,41,danielquerejazu,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,0,8,2014-05-06T15:59:55.492Z,1041,2014-05-14T17:03:54.734Z,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,multi

However, it is known that the virus spreads from human to human. In addition, bats and camels have been found to be infected with MERS. ??So far, all the cases have been linked to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula through residence in or travel to, indicating that modes of transmission outside of the Arabian Peninsula are through travel.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 5 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 5 is comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br><span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 5 is 1.7%.

This was a fundamental discovery; however, the process produced very low yields of stem cells. In addition, the changing of transcription factors tended to generate tumors.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January. The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 2 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 2 is comprised of New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br></span><span><span><br>The baseline value for the </span><span>2014-15 influenza season in Region 2 is 2.3%.<br><br></span>?In the event the start occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</span><br>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Region 2 Flu Start,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,0,17,2014-10-07T14:10:57.029Z,1449,2014-10-07T14:58:56.181Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 7 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 7 is the highest. Region 7 is comprised of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-15 00:05:59.779822,None,972,assumptive_dependency,None,None,973,None,None,None,Region 7 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T16:56:50.234Z,1475,None,None,,,,,multi

Transactinides and their isotopes are typically short lived, with half-lives of seconds or minutes, though an isotope of the element Dubnium (Db-268) has a half life of 29 hours - a record for a superheavy isotope. Much of the research on transactinide elements focuses on the discovery of the theorized 'island of stability' - a set of as-yet undiscovered isotopes of superheavy elements which are theorized to be more stable and have much longer half-lives than previously observed transuranium elements. The hypothesis is based upon the nuclear shell model, which implies that atomic nuclei are built up in ""shells"" in a manner similar to the structure of electron shells in atoms. <br><br>In May 2014, physicists created one of the heaviest elements yet, with an atomic number of 117, which has a half life of about 50 thousandths of a second. In the decay of element 177, two previously unknown isotopes were identified: Db-270 (dubnium) and Lr-266 (lawrencium).

It has a long neck, a long trunk, a long tail, a 7ft (2m) sail on its back and a snout like a crocodile.?And when we look at the body proportions, the animal was  clearly not as agile on land as other dinosaurs were, so I think it  spent a substantial amount of time in the water.""<br><br>Spinosaurus  had been an intriguing mystery for decades.

Its forelimbs were large and strong, with scythe-like claws; its  hind legs were short, with paddle-shaped feet.</span> Conical  teeth in a crocodilian snout overlapped like a snare for trapping fish,  and it had nostrils halfway up the skull so it could stick its snout  into the water and still breathe.<span>With  its flat feet, Spinosaurus may have paddled like a duck. It had a long,  flexible tail, which it may have used for propulsion. <br><br>?It?s like a  cross between an aquatic bird and a crocodile,? said Paul C.

Therefore, the authors call for a prize ?for the development of a maneuverable, station-keeping, stratospheric airship, which can stay aloft at an altitude above 65 kft (20 km) for at least a full diurnal cycle (&gt;20 hours) while carrying a science payload of at least 20 kg in mass? as part of a roadmap to stratospheric airship observatories.</li></ul>Links and sources<br><ul><li>Airships: A New Horizon for Science? <a href=""http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf</a></li><li>The flying bum! 300ft-long 'airship' unveiled in Britain is the world's longest aircraft <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-airship-unveiled-UK-hailed-game-changer.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2570118/Worlds-longest-aircraft-revealed-300ft-long-a...</a></li><li><a href=""http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf"">http://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/airship2013/presentations/smith.pdf</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pdf"">http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/Final_LTA_report.pdf</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.history.navy.mil/download/lta-10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.history.navy.mil/download/lta-10.pdf"">http://www.history.navy.mil/download/lta-10.pdf</a><br></li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/01/2018</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>Press release or other official announcement from company or research group.<br><br>This question will resolve when an announcement is made or by the resolution date, whichever one comes first.      <br><br></p><h4>Fine Print</h4><p>An airship can be a rigid, semi-rigid, or non-rigid lighter-than-air vehicles that can generate their own thrust for maneuvers.

Transactinides and their isotopes are typically short lived, with half-lives of seconds or minutes, though an isotope of the element Dubnium (Db-268) has a half life of 29 hours - a record for a superheavy isotope. <br><br>Much of the research on transactinide elements focuses on the discovery of the theorized 'island of stability' - a set of as-yet undiscovered isotopes of superheavy elements which are theorized to be more stable and have much longer half-lives than previously observed transuranium elements. The hypothesis is based upon the nuclear shell model, which implies that atomic nuclei are built up in ""shells"" in a manner similar to the structure of electron shells in atoms. In both cases, shells are just groups of quantum energy levelsthat are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap. So when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy level of a given shell in the nucleus, the binging energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells. A filled shell would have ""magic numbers""of neutrons and protons. One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126. <br><br>In May 2014, physicists created one of the heaviest elements yet, with an atomic number of 117, which? has a half life of about 50 thousandths of a second. In the decay of element 177, two previously unknown isotopes were identified: Db-270 (dubnium) and Lr-266 (lawrencium). With half-lives of about one hour and about 11 hours, respectively, they are among the longest-lived superheavy isotopes known to date, perhaps science closer to the fabled the island of stability.<br></p><div><ul><li><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superheavy-element-117-island-of-stability/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superheavy-element-117-island-of-stability/"">Scientific American - Superheavy Element 117 Points to Fabled ""Island of Stability"" on Periodic Table</a></li><li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability"">Wikipedia - Island of Stability</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140502081341.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140502081341.htm"">Science Daily - Approaching the island of stability: Observation of superheavy element 117</a><br></li></ul></div><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/01/2017</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p></p><div>The discovery of a transactinide isotope with a half life longer than that of Db-268 would represent a major breakthrough in physics and would likely be covered in a variety of academic journals, such a Nature Physics, as well as by the mainstream media and science publications.</div><br><p></p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,Atomic number island of stability,,,,41,danielquerejazu,,31,christinafreyman,26,christinafreyma,0,2,2014-05-15T17:32:09.951Z,1059,2014-06-04T18:48:40.156Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

As a fuel it accounts for roughly one third of all the energy production on planet Earth. Oil and gas reserves are defined according to how easily they can be recovered and separated into three categories: proven, probable, and possible. Probable and possible reserves are considered unproven. Proven reserves are considered to have a ""reasonable certainty"" of being recovered, though definitions of proven vary within the industry.<br><br>Total proven reserves can increase when new reserves are found (exploration), and when new technology makes a larger share of existing reserves recoverable (recovery). Technological advancements have nearly doubled the volume of reserves that ultimately are recoverable since 1980. Exploration has been enhanced through such technology as 3D geological modeling and considerable research is ongoing in the area of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), which applies a wide range of methods (thermal, chemical, physical, and even biological) to improve recovery.<br><br>Reserve measurement and classification requires assumptions and estimation, so estimates from different sources will not match exactly. This question uses estimates from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC publishes an Annual Statistical Bulletin that reports proven reserves by country. The most recent bulletin reports 265,789 million barrels of proven crude oil reserves for Saudi Arabia at the end of 2013, down 0.02% from 265,850 at the end of 2012.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 2 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 2 is the highest. Region 2 is comprised of New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-14 23:51:09.547403,None,947,assumptive_dependency,None,None,948,None,None,None,Region 2 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T14:11:02.870Z,1450,None,None,,,,,multi

While the initial discovery was serendipitous, a successful discovery program was introduced by Selman Waksman in the 1940s. Unfortunately, by the 1960s this method of antibiotic discovery was all but exhausted.?While a few small-scale alternatives were discovered in the 1960s there has been no discovery of a new class of broad-spectrum compounds. Due to use and overuse of antibiotics, resistant strains of bacteria are emerging more and more frequently, reinforcing our need for new classes of?effective antibiotics.?<br>?<br>Recently however, a new andibiotic, teixobactin, was discovered using a new way to cultivate bacteria in their native environment. The iChip, short for isolation chip, is a specialized device for cultivating these previously inaccessible microorganisms. The construction of the iChip allows the cells to grow in their natural environment while still keeping them isolated from the general population of bacteria.? Using this method instead of the traditional petri dish, researchers are now able to grow around 50% of organisms found in soil as opposed to the 1% which can be grown in a petri dish.

This was mentioned in one of the background papers as being a step before animal testing and is a good early indicator of whether or not a drug has potential. Further steps such as animal testing in mice or larger animals would surpass this standard and it?s possible that a paper would only be published when the research had reached the point of animal testing.

As a fuel it accounts for roughly one third of all the energy production on planet Earth. Oil and gas reserves are defined according to how easily they can be recovered and separated into three categories: proven, probable, and possible. Probable and possible reserves are considered unproven. Proven reserves are considered to have a ""reasonable certainty"" of being recovered, though definitions of proven vary within the industry.<br><br>Total proven reserves can increase when new reserves are found (exploration), and when new technology makes a larger share of existing reserves recoverable (recovery). Technological advancements have nearly doubled the volume of reserves that ultimately are recoverable since 1980. Exploration has been enhanced through such technology as 3D geological modeling and considerable research is ongoing in the area of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), which applies a wide range of methods (thermal, chemical, physical, and even biological) to improve recovery.<br><br>Reserve measurement and classification requires assumptions and estimation, so estimates from different sources will not match exactly.

OPEC will release the next Bulletin sometime in 2015, likely around midyear.<br><br>For more background, see:<br></p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/03/27/how-big-are-the-currently-known-oil-reserves-and-what-are-the-chances-of-finding-new-ones/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/03/27/how-big-are-the-currently-known-oil-reserves-and-what-are-the-chances-of-finding-new-ones/"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/03/27/how-big-are-the-currently-known-oil-reserves-and-what-a...</a></li><li><a href=""http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/oil-gas-research/enhanced-oil-recovery"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/oil-gas-research/enhanced-oil-recovery</a></li><li>   <a href=""http://www.emgs.com/content/675/3-D-EM-addresses-exploration-challenges"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.emgs.com/content/675/3-D-EM-addresses-exploration-challenges</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/202.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/202.htm</a></li></ul><p></p><br>This question is part of the SciCast Accuracy Contest.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 8 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 8 is the highest. Region 8 is comprised of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-15 00:06:11.092092,None,977,assumptive_dependency,None,None,978,None,None,None,Region 8 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T17:13:54.284Z,1480,None,None,,,,,multi

For government agencies the interest lies mainly in law and national security.? Numerous police departments in the US and recently the Calgary police in Canada have adopted facial recognition as a method of tracking down criminals.? Thus far there is no evidence that the police departments are comparing surveillance footage with ordinary citizens; rather, they use mug shots of known criminals and compare that to footage of criminals in the act.? However, privacy activists have pointed out the danger that in the future the comparison database will include driver's license photos, so every citizen can be tracked.<br><br> The National Institute of Standards and Statistics (NIST) recently ran a test of the variety of facial recognition services now on the market.? The accuracy varied wildly based on the quality of the photo, the number of images to search through, and age of the subject.? Younger subjects have more similar faces than older faces and therefore it is more difficult for the software to accurately identify young people.? The error rate of results ranged from 4.1% for the best software under the best circumstances, to 66.9% with the worst software and worst circumstances.? Other sources put the error rate of the FBI facial recognition software at around 20%, leading to concerns that false positives may become problematic, particularly if the comparison database is expanded to include driver's license photos.<br><br></span>In the private sector Facebook is also pursuing facial recognition software, ostensibly as an improvement over its current photo tagging system (see their <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/download/233199633549733/deepface.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">paper here</a>).? They have managed to reach an error rate of only 2.75%.? When it comes to recognizing the faces of other humans, people have an error rate of 2.47%, suggesting that Facebook is getting close to human levels of accuracy.? Part of their success is due to an advance they have made in one of the tricky areas of facial recognition.? Often in photographs the entire face of a person is not visible, rendering ordinary facial comparison difficult as it removes many of the comparison points.? Facebook has developed an algorithm which takes a face and adjusts it so that every face is compared at the same angle.? This technique has significantly improved their accuracy.   ?  <span><br><br>Sources:<br> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/download/233199633549733/deepface.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">https://www.facebook.com/download/233199633549733/deepface.pdf</a> <br> <a href=""http://rt.com/usa/deepface-instantaneous-facial-recognition-facebook-706/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://rt.com/usa/deepface-instantaneous-facial-recognition-facebook-706/"">http://rt.com/usa/deepface-instantaneous-facial-recognition-facebook-706/</a> <br> <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1354579-nist-8009.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1354579-nist-8009.html"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1354579-nist-8009.html</a> <br> <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/more-police-departments-are-using-facial-recognition-technology/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/more-police-departments-are-using-facial-recognition-technology/</a> <br><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/fbi-facial-recognition-system-at-full-operational-capability/"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/fbi-facial-recognition-system-at-full-operational-capability/</a> </span>  <br></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>01/01/2016</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p></p><div>Announced in an official Facebook announcement.</div><div>Previous announcements have been posted here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/making-photo-tagging-easier/467145887130"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/making-photo-tagging-easier/467145887130"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/making-photo-tagging-easier/467145887130</a></div><div><br></div><div>This question will resolve when an announcement is made or by the resolution date, whichever one comes first.<br><br>For additional information about the question resolution process, please see the following post on the SciCast blog: <a href=""http://blog.scicast.org/about/resolution"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""" title=""Link: http://blog.scicast.org/about/resolution"">http://blog.scicast.org/about/resolution</a></div><div><br></div><p></p>",None,,,,,,,,None,None,None,facebook tagging facial recognition software,,,,225,dylan.cohen,,31,christinafreyman,225,dylan.cohen,0,20,2014-11-06T20:38:49.863Z,1557,None,None,,,,,multi

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 9 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 9 is comprised of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br></span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 9 is 2.7%.

In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). Consequently, the total ILI count may also vary accordingly. For instance, if the ILL count has been published as 50000, the revised value could be, example, 50000 + 2%(50000) = 51000.</p>","{""sig_dig"":""0"",""min"":250,""max"":251500,""range"":[250,251500],""label"":"""",""stepSize"":""1250"",""prefix"":"""",""transformation"":""linear"",""bins"":[{""values"":[250,1500],""label"":""\""Less than 1,500 cases\""""},{""values"":[1500,10000],""label"":""\""1,500 to 10,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[10000,30000],""label"":""\""10,000 to 30,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[30000,60000],""label"":""\""30,000 to 60,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[60000,90000],""label"":""\""60,000 to 90,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[90000,150000],""label"":""\""90,000 to 150,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[150000,250000],""label"":""\""150,000 to 250,000 cases\""""},{""values"":[250000,251500],""label"":""\""250,000 or more cases\""""}],""suffix"":"" cases""}",2014-10-20 15:36:06.407020,None,984,assumptive_dependency,None,None,1015,None,None,None,Region 9 ILI Case Counts,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,8,2014-10-09T14:24:55.153Z,1506,None,None,,,,,binary

This year the country is expecting similar weather conditions and states are stocking up on road salt supplies in preparation for the severe winter forecast. For a variety of reasons, including anticipated salt shortages, analysts are expecting even higher road salt prices than last year, which ranged? from $20 to $164.69 per ton, depending on the state. As a result of the anticipated shortage in salt supplies and the rising prices, states around the country are experimenting with alternatives to road salt like beet juice, cheese brine, and waste water from fracking operations to melt ice on the roads; however, most of these options are not yet as effective as road salt.

Level two relates to multiple functions being automated such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, or self parking, and therefore still needs human supervision.  This can be generally referred to as semi-autonomous vehicles.  Level three relates to vehicles that are self-driving but under certain circumstances may need human control.  This can be generally referred to as limited self-driving autonomy.  Level four relates to vehicles that can operate fully autonomously including unmanned operation, and therefore need no human supervision at all.  This can be generally referred to as self-driving or autonomous cars in the real sense.  The current status of the automotive industry does not follow this classification exactly.  Therefore the ambiguous parts of the NHTSA definition will be defined for the purposes of this question, these are included in the brackets:  <br><br>A 'level 3 prototype' of an autonomous vehicle refers to the Limited Self-Driving Automation, or Level Three of the NHTSA classification of autonomous vehicles:  ""Vehicles at this level of automation enable the driver to cede full control of all safety-critical functions [this includes acceleration, braking, steering, and lane changing/turning] under certain traffic or environmental conditions and in those conditions to rely heavily on the vehicle to monitor for changes in those conditions requiring transition back to the driver control [however the vehicle must be able to detect objects other than cars such as pedestrians or traffic lights and respond autonomously].  The driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time.  The Google (self-driving Prius) car is an example of limited self-driving automation.""  For example, the 2015 Hyundai Genesis cannot make autonomous lane changes or turns, and cannot autonomously respond to detected objects (other than cars), and is therefore labeled with level two autonomy.  Additionally, the decision to categorize a vehicle as level three for resolution may be at the discretion of the question author.  <br><br>A ?prototype? is defined as a full scale vehicle or an autonomous added feature to an existing vehicle that has demonstrated level 3 functionality.  This means that an announcement of development or research by the manufacturer by itself does not suffice, an actual prototype must be built.  <br><br>An ?automobile manufacturer? is defined here to be one of the twenty manufacturers listed, and is the largest in the chain of ownership.

In 2006, Dr. Shinya Yamanaka led a group that discovered that differentiated soatic cells could be reprogrammed into a pluripotent stem cell by changing the transcription factors. This was a fundamental discovery; however, the process produced very low yields of stem cells. In addition, the changing of transcription factors tended to generate tumors.

The project?s goal is to keep dismounted soldiers as well equipped as possible from gun shot wounds and explosions through next generation technologies like an exoskeleton made of liquid armor, smart fabrics to stop hemorrhaging, enhanced sensor capabilities and Google-glass like visuals. These suits would be donned by U.S. special operations forces and would be able to monitor the user's vital signs, give him/her real-time battlefield information and be bulletproof from head to toe.<br><br>Threat detection is one of the critical concerns of dismounted soldiers. With advances in sensor technologies, acoustic, radar, imaging, and other multisensory technologies can help soldiers detect enemy shots/artillery from a very long distance to better prepare them with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 5 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 5 is the highest. Region 5 is comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.",None,2014-10-15 00:02:16.854857,None,962,assumptive_dependency,None,None,963,None,None,None,Region 5 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T15:46:05.943Z,1465,2014-10-07T15:52:52.378Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

Our group aims to understand how cell movement is regulated, using a mixture of genetics and microscopy. <br><br>We are interested in several aspects of cell movement.</i><i>One is chemotaxis, in which external signals orient and attract cells, which is increasingly seen as a fundamental cause of metastasis. Metastasis, one of the most feared features of cancer, is caused when cells migrate out from a tumour into the blood, lymph or other tissues. Chemotaxis is clearly important in these processes but exactly how and why remain poorly understood.<br><br></i><i>Another is the regulation of actin polymerization. Actin is the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells. It polymerizes into filaments that provide the mechanical force needed to push cells forwards. It also has a number of other biological roles. We are most interested in actin's roles in cell movement and vesicle sorting. In cell movement, the SCAR/WAVE complex, a large multiprotein assembly, promotes movement through the formation of large pseudopods. In vesicles, a related multiprotein complex based around WASH causes actin to polymerize on vesicles, where it mediates sorting of different components within the cell.</i><br><span><br><i>We study these two processes in a range of different cells, particularly</i><i>?</i><i>Dictyostelium</i><i>?</i><i>and melanoma cells.</i><i>?</i><i>Dictyostelium</i><i>?</i><i>is an amoeba in which the genetic analysis of movement is especially straightforward, and it has been the best experimental organism for studying chemotaxis.

We use the standard deviation (SD) of these rates of change to compute a uniform bin width of 0.5 SDs and center the middle bin on the calculated Center Point described above. This creates an overall range of +/- 1.75 SDs (roughly 90% of the average variation in Year Over Year change) in the 7 interior bins of each questions, to which upper and lower tails are added.</li></ul><p></p><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4><p>07/31/2014</p><h4>Resolution Source</h4><p>The CDC's 2014 National Immunization Survey (NIS) - Teen.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS Region 10 goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week. Region 10 is comprised of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br><span>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 10 is 1.1%.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.The 'start week' is defined as the first week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits in Region 7 exceeds the corresponding baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively. The calculated baselines for 2013-2014 season can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm</a> while details of the previous seasons can be found at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target="""">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm</a>. Region 7 is comprised of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.</span><span><span><br><br>The baseline value for the 2014-15 influenza season in Region 7 is 1.7%.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.<br><br>The 'end week' is defined as the first week after the peak week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across the US (all 10 HHS regions) goes below the baseline for three consecutive weeks, starting from the said week. The baseline for the end week is the same as the baseline for the start week.<br><br>ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.<br><br>The National baseline for the 2014-2015 flu season is 2.0%.<br><br>In the event the end occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.",None,2014-10-14 21:07:11.231615,None,927,assumptive_dependency,None,None,926,None,None,None,National Flu End,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,11,2014-09-16T16:43:39.949Z,1410,2014-09-29T19:26:42.471Z,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,multi

The device learns your preferred temperature settings and programs itself to your personal schedule, detecting when you are a way and changing your home?s temperature accordingly. Additionally, one can connect with their device remotely to adjust the temperature of their house or modify the heating schedule. Nest and other smart thermostats are projected to have an incredibly high market penetration, up to nearly 70%, over the next few years and, therefore, are a useful indicator for the adoption for the Internet of Things. However, as a result of this rapid adoption, homeowners are opening themselves to a greater risk of cyber attacks.<br> <br> ?We?re at a crisis point now with regard to the security of embedded systems, where computing is embedded into the hardware itself ? as with the Internet of Things.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week.

In other words, for a particular year, the ILI season is said to begin when the weighted percentage of ILI related patient visits exceeds a predefined baseline for three consecutive weeks (first week in the three week sequence). This ?baseline? is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard deviations. The baseline is calculated separately for the national and the individual regions using the historical data for the national and the individual regions, respectively.

Since then the distance over which the quantum phenomenon has been achieved has grown steadily, and now stands as 143 kilometers across free space. The mark was achieved in September of 2012 between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. 97 Kilometers was achieved just a month earlier.

It is used by epidemiologists all over the world. In the United States, epi weeks are defined as running from Sunday to Saturday, where the first epi week of the year is defined to be the one which ends on the first Saturday of January, and contains at least four days of January. For example, the first epi-week of 2014 started on 2013/12/29 as it contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/04) and 4 days of the January in that week. On the contrary, the first epi-week of 2009 started on 2009/01/04 because the week that contained the first Saturday of January (2013/01/03) had only 3 days of January.For this question, the 'peak week' of the season for HHS Region 3 is defined as the week for which the weighted percentage of ILI related visits across HHS region 3 is the highest. Region 3 is comprised of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.ILINet can revise published values over time. In general, values are revised upward so that at any point in time, published values can be viewed as a lower bound over the final values. In practice, revisions are typically in the range of 1-3% (of the weighted percentage value). For instance, if the weighted percentage has been published as 0.8%, the revised value could be, example, 0.8 + 2%(0.8) = 0.816%.In the event the peak occurs outside the range of weeks listed, this question will resolve at the nearest extreme.</p>",None,2014-10-14 23:58:39.253521,None,952,assumptive_dependency,None,None,953,None,None,None,Region 3 Flu Peak,,30,rfuoco,5,rfuoco,,1253,saqibtq,124,saqibtq,0,1,2014-10-07T15:15:36.914Z,1455,None,None,,,,,multi

Optogenetics makes use of light-absorbing proteins called opsins, which are found in the eyes of humans and other animals and in microbes. By genetically splicing opsins into neurons, scientists can manipulate the behavior of the neurons by exposing them to light. To stimulate superficial brain areas such as the cerebral cortex, optical fibers or LED lights can be directly mounted to the skull of the test subject. More deeply implanted optical fibers have been used to deliver light to deeper brain areas.</div><div><br></div><div>Optogenetics was chosen as the Method of the Year in 2010 across all fields of science and engineering by the interdisciplinary research journal Nature Methods, and it has been proposed as a possible treatment for various neurological disorders.

While at the MIND, he worked in the lab of Dr. Wilma Wasco, where Dr. Myre received the Edward R. and Anne G. Lefler Postdoctoral Fellowship and established work that led to the identification of a novel small molecule with anti-amyloid properties isolated from the lower organism Dictyostelium.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Dr. Myre then moved to the lab of Dr. James F. Gusella, where he initiated a collaborative effort with a group at the NIH to study presenilin function in Dictyostelium. During his time in Dr. Gusella's lab, Dr. Myre also received an award from the CHDI Foundation Inc., as a CO-PI, to study the function of huntingtin in Dictyostelium. This led to the first publication to describe the normal function of huntingtin in this lower model system.</i></div><div><br></div><div><i>Currently, Dr. Myre's research interests include signal transduction pathways, membrane-protein signaling, posttranslational modifications, protein-protein interactions and gene expression. The deregulation of many of these processes has been implicated in the development of disease, yet the normal function of the disease protein remains elusive, and limits the potential for the discovery of therapeutic approaches. To address these questions of function, Dr. Myre utilizes the lower model organism Dictyostelium discoideum, together with access to human and mouse systems, as an inexpensive, yet rapid method to gain knowledge on the conserved function of proteins linked to Alzheimer's , Huntington's, Parkinson's and Batten's disease. Any biological discoveries, when assessed in mammals, will not only illuminate conserved basic, cellular mechanisms, but in the long term provide potential molecular targets for the treatment of disease. This approach has created unique opportunities for collaborative research both within industry and academia on an international scale.</i><br><br></div><b>Useful Links</b><br><ul><li><a href=""http://chgr.org/index-faculty_myre.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link to?Myre Lab</a></li><li><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/dictyworldrace2014/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race Official Webpage</a></li><li><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450904579369372368336300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dicty World Race in the Wall Street Journal</a></li><li>Link to Dicty Live Stream Site (Coming Soon!)</li></ul><h4>Accepting Forecasts Until:</h4>05/17/14<h4>Resolution Source</h4>This question will be resolved based on reporting by the Official Dicty World Race 2014 live stream website.<h4>Fine Print</h4>The first 500 cells to finish the race will be tracked and grouped by the cell type.
